[DataGather.py](https://github.com/blazepower/DSCI_133_Project/blob/master/DataGather.py) is code which gathers and cleans the candidates Tweets. 

The [Tweets folder](https://github.com/blazepower/DSCI_133_Project/tree/master/Tweets) contains those Tweets as gathered on 4/22/29.

Take a look at the [RunTime Videos and Output](https://github.com/blazepower/DSCI_133_Project/tree/master/RunTime_Videos_and_Output) to see videos of our code running and the outputs that they produce.
