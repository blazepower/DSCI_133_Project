[DataGather.py](https://github.com/blazepower/DSCI_133_Project/blob/master/DataGather.py) is code which gathers and cleans the candidates Tweets. 

The [Tweets](https://github.com/blazepower/DSCI_133_Project/tree/master/Tweets) folder contains those Tweets as gathered on 4/22/29 in the form of Excel Workbooks.

The [Data](https://github.com/blazepower/DSCI_133_Project/tree/master/Data) folder contains CSV files containing the scores of the individual Tweets by each candidate.

Take a look at the [RunTime Videos and Output](https://github.com/blazepower/DSCI_133_Project/tree/master/RunTime_Videos_and_Output) folder to see videos of our code running and the outputs that they produce.
